Welcome to the 1403 Programming Packet
===================================

First let's start with the very basics of programming. 

When writing code every minor detail matters. 
Whether that be a missing semicolon at the end of a line or wrong captialization. 
Either of these will result in errors; which could end up being difficult to spot.
When writing code all code is executed sequentially. Each statement does exactly what is says, no ifs or buts.
